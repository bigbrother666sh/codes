description: Transform Claude Code into a fully autonomous agent system with persistent memory, scheduled operations, computer use, and task queuing. Replaces standalone agent frameworks (Hermes, AutoGPT) by leveraging Claude Code's native crons, dispatch, MCP tools, and memory. Use when the user wants continuous autonomous operation, scheduled tasks, or a self-directing agent loop.

# Autonomous Agent Harness

Turn Claude Code into a persistent, self-directing agent system using only native features and MCP servers.

## When to Activate

- User wants an agent that runs continuously or on a schedule
- Setting up automated workflows that trigger periodically
- Building a personal AI assistant that remembers context across sessions
- User says "run this every day", "check on this regularly", "keep monitoring"
- Wants to replicate functionality from Hermes, AutoGPT, or similar autonomous agent frameworks
- Needs computer use combined with scheduled execution

## Core Components

### 1. Persistent Memory

Use Claude Code's built-in memory system enhanced with MCP memory server for structured data.

**Built-in memory** (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`):
- User preferences, feedback, project context
- Stored as markdown files with frontmatter
- Automatically loaded at session start

**MCP memory server** (structured knowledge graph):
- Entities, relations, observations
- Queryable graph structure
- Cross-session persistence

**Memory patterns:**

```
# Short-term: current session context
Use TodoWrite for in-session task tracking

# Medium-term: project memory files
Write to ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/ for cross-session recall

# Long-term: MCP knowledge graph
Use mcp__memory__create_entities for permanent structured data
Use mcp__memory__create_relations for relationship mapping
Use mcp__memory__add_observations for new facts about known entities
```

### 2. Scheduled Operations (Crons)

Use Claude Code's scheduled tasks to create recurring agent operations.

**Useful cron patterns:**

| Pattern | Schedule | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Daily standup | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Review PRs, issues, deploy status |
| Weekly review | `0 10 * * 1` | Code quality metrics, test coverage |
| Hourly monitor | `0 * * * *` | Production health, error rate checks |
| Nightly build | `0 2 * * *` | Run full test suite, security scan |

### 3. Dispatch / Remote Agents

Trigger Claude Code agents remotely for event-driven workflows.

### 4. Task Queue

Manage a persistent queue of tasks that survive session boundaries.

**Implementation:**

```
# Task persistence via memory
Write task queue to ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/task-queue.md

# Task format
---
name: task-queue
type: project
description: Persistent task queue for autonomous operation

## Active Tasks
- [ ] PR #123: Review and approve if CI green
- [ ] Monitor deploy: check /health every 30 min for 2 hours
- [ ] Research: Find 5 leads in AI tooling space

## Completed
- [x] Daily standup: reviewed 3 PRs, 2 issues
```

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Configure MCP Servers

Ensure `memory` and other relevant MCP servers are in `~/.claude.json`.

### Step 2: Create Base Crons

```bash
# Daily morning briefing
claude -p "Create a scheduled task: every weekday at 9am, review my GitHub notifications, open PRs, and calendar. Write a morning briefing to memory."

# Continuous learning
claude -p "Create a scheduled task: every Sunday at 8pm, extract patterns from this week's sessions and update the learned skills."
```

### Step 3: Initialize Memory Graph

```bash
# Bootstrap your identity and context
claude -p "Create memory entities for: me (user profile), my projects, my key contacts. Add observations about current priorities."
```

## Example Workflows

### Autonomous PR Reviewer
```
Cron: every 30 min during work hours
1. Check for new PRs on watched repos
2. For each new PR:
   - Pull branch locally
   - Run tests
   - Review changes with code-reviewer agent
   - Post review comments via GitHub MCP
3. Update memory with review status
```

### Personal Research Agent
```
Cron: daily at 6 AM
1. Check saved search queries in memory
2. Run web searches for each query
3. Summarize new findings
4. Compare against yesterday's results
5. Write digest to memory
6. Flag high-priority items for morning review
```

## Constraints

- Cron tasks run in isolated sessions — they don't share context with interactive sessions unless through memory.
- Computer use requires explicit permission grants. Don't assume access.
- Remote dispatch may have rate limits. Design crons with appropriate intervals.
- Memory files should be kept concise. Archive old data rather than letting files grow unbounded.
- Always verify that scheduled tasks completed successfully. Add error handling to cron prompts.
