# skill-comply: Automated Compliance Measurement

Measures whether coding agents actually follow skills, rules, or agent definitions by:
1. Auto-generating expected behavioral sequences (specs) from any .md file
2. Auto-generating scenarios with decreasing prompt strictness (supportive → neutral → competing)
3. Running `claude -p` and capturing tool call traces via stream-json
4. Classifying tool calls against spec steps using LLM
5. Generating self-contained reports with spec, prompts, and timelines

## Supported Targets

- **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): Workflow skills like search-first, TDD guides
- **Rules** (`rules/common/*.md`): Mandatory rules like testing.md, security.md
- **Agent definitions** (`agents/*.md`): Whether an agent gets invoked when expected

## Usage

```bash
# Full run
uv run python -m scripts.run ~/.claude/rules/common/testing.md

# Dry run (no cost, spec + scenarios only)
uv run python -m scripts.run --dry-run ~/.claude/skills/search-first/SKILL.md

# Custom models
uv run python -m scripts.run --gen-model haiku --model sonnet <path>
```

## Key Concept: Prompt Independence

Measures whether a skill/rule is followed even when the prompt doesn't explicitly support it.

## Report Contents

- Expected behavioral sequence (auto-generated spec)
- Scenario prompts at each strictness level
- Compliance scores per scenario
- Tool call timelines with LLM classification labels
